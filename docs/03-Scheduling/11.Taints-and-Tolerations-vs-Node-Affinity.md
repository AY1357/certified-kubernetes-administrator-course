# Taints and Tolerations vs Node Affinity
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/taints-and-tolerations-vs-node-affinity/)

In this section, we will take a look at Taints and Tolerations vs Node Affinity.

Let's rake a look at a scenario in which we have 5 NODEs and 5 PODs, we want to place each POD, based on it's "color" to the matching NODE (match by color).
We can use "Taints" to `taint` the NODE to a specific "color" and use `tolerations` on the POD's to apply tolerance to the corresponding POD (configure the blue POD with `tolerations` to "blue" so that the "blue POD" will NOT end up being scheduled/deployed on the "green" NODE or the "red" NODE).
But we need to remember, that in the example before us we have 5 NODEs, 3 of the with `taint` and the other 2 are without any `taint`, thus the "scheduler" might schedule the POD's on the 2 "un-tainted" NODEs.

Thus ->
- Taints and Tolerations do not guarantee that the pods will only prefer these nodes; in this case, the red pods may end up on one of the other nodes that do not have a taint or toleration set.

For Example, by using `NODE Affinity` method by "labeling" the NODEs with the corresponding color (blue, red, green), we then will set the `Node Selectors` on the PODs to "tie" the PODs to the NODEs. As such, the PODs will end up on the desired NODEs. BUT! we must not forget the other 2 PODs that do not have any `Node Selector` set, and they might end up being shceduled on on of the "colored" NODEs
 
- As such, a combination of taints and tolerations and node affinity rules can be used together to completely dedicate nodes for specific PODs.
We will first used `taints` & `tolerations` (as described previously) and then we will use `node affinity` to bind the "colored" PODs to their corresponding NODEs.
